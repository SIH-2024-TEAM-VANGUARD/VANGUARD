## Problem Statement

**Description:**  

Background: Department of Justice (DoJ) headed by the Secretary is a part of Ministry of Law & Justice, Government of India. Along with the functions of the Department of Justice as per the Allocation of Business (Rules), 1961, implements important schemes for Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary, setting up of Special Courts for speedy trial and disposal of cases of sensitive nature (Fast Track Special Court for cases of rape and POCSO Act), eCourts Project on computerization of various courts across the country, legal aid to poor and access to justice, financial assistance to National Judicial Academy for providing training to the Judicial Officers of the country.  Description: The above problem statement envisages a Chatbot or virtual assistant be developed to understand the user and allow them to ask questions and get information related to DoJ such as o Know about the various divisions of DoJ, o Number of Judges appointed at Supreme Court, High Courts, District & Subordinate Courts and current vacancies. o Pendency of cases through National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) o Procedure to pay fine of traffic violation o Live Streaming of Court Cases o Steps for the eFiling and ePay o Know about working Fast track courts o Ways to download eCourts Services Mobile app o Availing Tele Law Services o Know current status of case This chatbot should be able to learn over time to add excellent value to customer interactions and should be capable for handling large data sets if scope expanded.  Expected Solution: An interactive Chatbot or virtual assistant be developed for the Department of Justice website resulting into desired information as per the command.

## Project Overview

Objective: To develop a standalone AI-based interactive chatbot website for the Department of Justice using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique and Python. The chatbot will provide users with accurate and relevant information related to legal processes, court procedures, and other relevant topics.

Key Features:
* Natural Language Understanding: The chatbot will be able to understand and respond to user queries in a natural language format.
* Knowledge Base Integration: The chatbot will leverage a curated knowledge base of legal information to provide accurate and informative responses.
* RAG Implementation: The RAG technique will be employed to retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base and generate comprehensive and contextually appropriate responses.
* User-Friendly Interface: The chatbot will have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and interact with

**Challenge:**  
1. Knowledge Base Creation:
* Data Collection: Gather relevant legal information from various sources, including statutes, case law, and legal documents.
* Data Structuring: Organize the collected data into a structured format, such as a knowledge graph or semantic network.
* Quality Assurance: Ensure the accuracy and completeness of the knowledge base through rigorous quality control measures.

2. RAG Model Development:
* Model Selection: Choose a suitable RAG model architecture, such as Phi3 .
* Training: Train the RAG model on the curated knowledge base to learn the relationships between queries and relevant information.
* Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the model on specific legal datasets to improve its performance on legal-related queries.

3. Chatbot Development:
* Web Framework: Choose a suitable web framework like Flask or Django.
* User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Chatbot Integration: Integrate the RAG model into the web application to handle user queries and generate responses.

4. Evaluation and Refinement:
* Performance Metrics: Evaluate the chatbot's performance using metrics such as accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction.
* Continuous Improvement: Gather feedback from users and iterate on the chatbot's capabilities to improve its effectiveness over time.

### Python Libraries and Tools

* Transformers: For implementing the RAG model and natural language processing tasks.
* Flask or Django: For building the web application.                                                                         *other libraries : Lang chain , torch , numpy                                                                                                    text to speech model
